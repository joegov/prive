Da Washing Machine

As online databases grow they become a vector for building illegal databases that may be used to break our stateâ€™s privacy laws. Black Hat hackers using mashups and sophisticated algorithms are already using online social data to reconstruct accurate personal profiles and commit identity theft. Government data must not assist this activity. 

The purpose of our project is to build an efficient data washer that will ensure such that any illegal interpretation of data will be impossible.
